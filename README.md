# Music-Barter
Aims to create a site where musicians can use a barter system to gain goods/services from other musicians. For example one musician may trade guitar lessons for the use of a practice room in New York City or a musician may trade their performance of a bass line on a track for the talents of another musician's flute solo in a live performance.
